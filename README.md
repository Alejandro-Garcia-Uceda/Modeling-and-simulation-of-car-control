# Modeling-and-simulation-of-car-control
This project is a physics simulation to a car response in differents situation and forces. 

This is the code of my Final Degree Project (TFG) done in 2018 to the Physics Degree at the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM), To find out how to obtain the ordinary differential equation (ODE) read the project paper (https://www.academia.edu/42824481/MODELADO_Y_SIMULACION_DE_CONTROL_DE_UN_COCHE?source=swp_share)

The differents files in the folder are:
1. cocheH.WRL: The world and the automobile modeled.
3. CarSimulation.m: Matlab simulation code.
4. videoruedas2.mp4: Short video with the car's response to wheel spinning.

To run correctly it is necessary to connect a Joystick and run CarSimulation.m. After a while the simulation will stop, if you want to run it longer without stopping, modify the number of the constant in the while loop.
